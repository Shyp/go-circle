# Bigtext

This uses Quicksilver.app to display large text on your Mac's screen. Only
works with Mac and only works with Quicksilver at the moment. Open to
suggestions for compatibility with other tools.

My screenshotting capabilities are utterly failing me, but it looks good, trust
me.

## Usage

```go
package main

import "github.com/kevinburke/bigtext"

func main() {
	bigtext.Display("why hello there")
}
```
